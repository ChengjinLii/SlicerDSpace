# SlicerDDSurfer Release and Archive Checklist

This checklist defines the release path for code, model assets, validation
metadata, and DOI-backed archival records. It is intended for maintainers who
prepare a public release or a manuscript-linked release.

## Release Scope

SlicerDDSurfer release artifacts are split into three classes:

1. Source code and documentation in this repository.
2. Manifest-managed model weights and templates in the independent
   `SlicerDDSurfer-models` repository, downloaded to a user-selected asset root
   and verified by size and SHA256.
3. External software installed separately by users, including 3D Slicer,
   SlicerDMRI, MRtrix3, FSL, FreeSurfer-compatible tools, WMA, TractQuerier,
   and TractCloud.

The top-level BSD-3-Clause license applies to SlicerDDSurfer source code unless
a file or bundled third-party component states different terms. It does not
grant redistribution rights for external tools, model weights, templates, or
subject-derived data whose terms must be reviewed separately.

## Pre-Tag Checks

Run these checks from a clean worktree:

```bash
make test-fast
python3 scripts/release_audit.py
python3 scripts/download_model_assets.py --profile core --asset-root /path/to/model-assets --verify-only
python3 scripts/download_model_assets.py --profile all --asset-root /path/to/model-assets --verify-only
SMOKE_ASSET_MODE=download scripts/smoke_fresh_clone.sh
SLICERDDSURFER_RELEASE_SUBJECT_ROOT=/path/to/subject-root \
  SLICERDDSURFER_RELEASE_ARGS="--skip-slicer-smoke --warn-only --asset-mirror-dir /path/to/core-mirror --all-asset-mirror-dir /path/to/all-mirror" \
  make release-plan
```

The release gate treats code checkout and model-asset download as separate
operations. Fresh-clone smoke uses `GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1` only to avoid any
legacy/test-fixture LFS materialization in the code checkout.
The CI-safe mode (`SMOKE_ASSET_MODE=plan`) resolves the manifest and runs fast
tests without downloading large model files. The release gate must use
`SMOKE_ASSET_MODE=download`, which runs `scripts/download_model_assets.py` with
an explicit profile and checksum verification. Do not treat a developer checkout
that already has materialized LFS files as proof that new users can install the
release.

If Slicer is available, also run:

```bash
SLICERDDSURFER_SLICER_LAUNCHER=/path/to/Slicer \
SLICERDDSURFER_XVFB_RUN=/path/to/xvfb-run \
  make test-slicer
```

On a workstation or VNC session that already has a display server, use:

```bash
SLICERDDSURFER_SLICER_LAUNCHER=/path/to/Slicer \
SLICERDDSURFER_USE_EXISTING_DISPLAY=1 \
  make test-slicer
```

The GitHub Actions `Release` workflow exposes the fresh-clone smoke gate only as
a manual `workflow_dispatch` input. Push and pull request CI downloads only the
small sentinel asset, not the model profiles.

The same manual `Release` workflow can create or update the draft GitHub Release
page by setting `create_github_release=true`. To attach fresh-clone evidence to
the release in the same run, also set `run_fresh_clone_smoke=true`.

If GitHub reports `some jobs were not successful`, first confirm that the latest
commit is being inspected and that branch protection no longer requires old
manual release jobs. With a token that can read repository Actions and branch
protection, run:

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=<token> \
  python3 scripts/check_github_ci_status.py \
  --repository ChengjinLii/SlicerDDSurfer \
  --ref $(git rev-parse HEAD) \
  --branch main
```

The normal required check should be `CI / fast-checks` or `fast-checks`. Remove
stale required checks such as `fresh-clone-smoke`, `create-github-release`, or
`create-github-release-with-smoke` from GitHub branch protection. The manual
`Release` workflow is still available for fresh-clone smoke and draft release
creation, but it should not be required for every push or pull request.

## Asset Terms Review

Before archiving model or validation assets, review:

- `docs/assets/MODEL_ASSETS.md`
- `docs/assets/MODEL_ASSET_TERMS.md`
- `docs/assets/MODEL_ASSET_HOSTING_PLAN.md`
- `models/assets_manifest.json`

Do not include an LFS-managed asset in a DOI archive until its source,
ownership, license, redistribution rights, and archive permissions are known.
If an asset is restricted, document the restriction in the release notes and
availability statement.

If `docs/assets/MODEL_ASSET_TERMS.md` still marks redistribution or DOI-archive permission
as unconfirmed, publish only a code/documentation release or exclude the affected
assets from the DOI archive.
Use `docs/assets/MODEL_ASSET_HOSTING_PLAN.md` to prepare a separate asset repository or
DOI-backed mirror without moving large weights into the code archive.

## Tagging

Use a semantic or manuscript-linked tag after the code, documentation, and
validation route are frozen:

```bash
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "SlicerDDSurfer vX.Y.Z"
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

For Nature Protocols preparation, use a stable manuscript-linked tag only after
the manuscript scope, validation subject, timing evidence, source-data package,
and asset terms are finalized.

## DOI Archive

Archive the release through Zenodo, Figshare, an institutional repository, or
another DOI-backed service. The included `.zenodo.json` is a metadata starting
point. Before publishing the DOI record:

- Confirm the release tag being archived.
- Confirm that restricted model weights, templates, and validation data are not
  included unless redistribution is allowed.
- Include `CITATION.cff`, `codemeta.json`, `LICENSE`, and the release
  validation report.
- Record the DOI in the release notes and manuscript Code Availability section.

Use `docs/release/DOI_ARCHIVE_PREP.md` and the files generated by `make release-artifacts`
as the code-only archive checklist and asset-exclusion record.

For the existing `v0.1.0` tag, `docs/release/GITHUB_RELEASE_DRAFT_v0.1.0.md` contains a
ready-to-review GitHub Release body and attachment list. If post-tag changes on
`main` should be included, create a new tag after rerunning the release gates
rather than moving `v0.1.0`.

To create the draft GitHub Release page and upload the default code-only support
files from a maintainer machine instead of GitHub Actions:

```bash
python3 scripts/create_github_release.py --dry-run \
  --expected-commit <full-tested-commit-sha> \
  --fresh-clone-report /path/to/fresh_clone_smoke_report.json
# Configure GITHUB_TOKEN or GH_TOKEN securely before the write operation.
  python3 scripts/create_github_release.py \
  --expected-commit <full-tested-commit-sha> \
  --fresh-clone-report /path/to/fresh_clone_smoke_report.json
```

Both commands validate the actual report content. Evidence must cover a real
`core` download and verification, all required successful steps, and the exact
commit being released. Plan-only and sentinel checks are insufficient. Existing
tags must resolve to that commit. The helper refuses to replace assets on an
already public release; use a new version for corrections. Draft creation is
not a substitute for the SDK build, packaged installation and scientific review
required before public release.

## Post-Release Updates

After a release tag and DOI exist:

1. Update `CITATION.cff` with the final version and DOI.
2. Update `codemeta.json` with the final version and identifier.
3. Update release notes and availability text with the repository URL, release
   tag, DOI, license, and asset restrictions.
