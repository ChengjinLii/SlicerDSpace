Start with the compact-interface tutorial. Technical guides describe individual
routes; dated reports preserve historical evidence, not universal guarantees.

## Maintainer Guides

- [Extension readiness](release/EXTENSION_READINESS.md): packaging, SDK commands and release gates.
- [Release procedure](release/RELEASE.md): code-only archives, assets, tags and evidence.
- [Repository layout](architecture/REPOSITORY_LAYOUT.md): anatomical, microstructural and connectivity packages.
- [Product architecture](architecture/PRODUCT_ARCHITECTURE.md): native client, optional dependencies, isolated backends and release boundaries.

## Validation Records

[21 October bundle workflow review](release/BUNDLE_WORKFLOW_20261021.md)
records automatic input handoff, three-subject WMQL re-auditing, saved WMA
re-auditing, actual TractCloud runs and sampling warnings, and isolated scene tests.

[16 October follow-up](release/QC_FOLLOWUP_20261016.md) records verified MK-Curve
exclusion, per-metric regional coverage, completed ACT-v3/WMA and Linux SDK/CPack
checks, plus the unresolved endpoint-WMQL sampling and anatomical-review gates.

[CSD/ACT investigation](release/CSD_ACT_DIAGNOSIS_20261015.md) supersedes the
earlier CSD acceptance: VentralDC tissue mapping was wrong, the controlled saved-FOD
experiment isolates its effect, and old ACT-dependent outputs require regeneration.

[Current platform audit](release/PLATFORM_AUDIT_20261015.md) records Windows/WSL
device and bridge fixes, macOS path support, timing boundaries and unverified routes.

[Current bundle QC follow-up](release/BUNDLE_QC_20261015.md) explains legacy green states,
sampling gates, real input diagnostics and platform limitations.
[WMQL CST diagnosis](release/WMQL_CST_20261015.md) distinguishes the legacy
crossing query from the published endpoint rule, with paired inputs and frozen imports.

[Bundle backend verification](release/BUNDLE_BACKENDS_20261013.md) separates
real WMA failures, sparse WMQL candidates and seed-verified TractCloud products.
[Module runtimes](release/MODULE_RUNTIMES_20261017.md) inventories historical and
new measurements without treating cache reuse or ROI timings as full computations.
[Performance optimizations](release/PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATIONS.md) distinguishes
original-author WMA comparisons with byte-identical geometry from older-plugin
iterations, inherited improvements, device effects and cache reuse.

[SAF Python verification](release/SAF_PYTHON_20261013.md) records independent
author-kernel comparisons, intentional corrections and actual tractogram geometry checks.

[Current DDSurfer synchronization](release/DDSURFER_SYNC_20261013.md) records
RAS-marked OBJ export, Python labels and batched fsaverage mapping with real-output comparisons.
[Pipeline QC and performance](release/PIPELINE_QC_20261015.md) records current
failure gates, full-brain NODDI repeatability, completed DKI/postprocessing checks
and the remaining anatomical and platform acceptance boundaries.
[Scientific follow-up](release/SCIENTIFIC_CLOSURE_20261015.md) adds full-brain
MK-Curve/reference checks, unchanged author WMQL on new UKF tracks, and the
status of the new WMA/joint GUI runs. Human review remains explicit and pending.
[Python MK-Curve verification](release/MKCURVE_PYTHON_20261012.md) records the
native Python correction route and independent author-code comparisons.

[Masking/microstructure/scene follow-up](release/PIPELINE_MASK_MICROSTRUCTURE_20261012.md)
records the PNL default, DKI eligibility, independent Advanced switches and
current-run automatic result loading, including the unverified MATLAB boundary.

[12 October follow-up](release/DISTRIBUTION_VALIDATION_20261012.md) records
license notices, fresh-clone tests, local installation and the outstanding SDK gate.
[11 October validation](release/DISTRIBUTION_VALIDATION_20261011.md) preserves
the preceding working-tree campaign; its test count is not the scoped Git snapshot's count.

[Scientific/GUI campaign](release/SLICER_ACCEPTANCE_20261007.md),
[compact UI](release/UI_SIMPLIFICATION_20261008.md), and
[DDSurfer synchronization](release/DDSURFER_SYNC_20261005.md) are dated records.
Older Beginner/wizard descriptions are not the current interaction guide.

Documentation follows DDSurfer's centered masthead and section navigation.
Pinned upstream Markdown and third-party license texts are left unchanged
to preserve their recorded hashes and attribution.
