This page is for users who want to run SlicerDSpace from 3D Slicer on macOS.
Use the Slicer UI first; use Terminal only when troubleshooting.

Native macOS scientific execution and real SDK packaging are not certified.
These are setup instructions, not a completed platform acceptance record.

See the [feature/platform matrix](SUPPORT_MATRIX.md) for native candidates,
external-tool requirements and explicitly unavailable features.

## 1. Install 3D Slicer

Download and install 3D Slicer from <https://www.slicer.org/>.

Install the module following the project README, open SlicerDSpace, then use
**Environment and installation**. No automatic wizard is shown.

---

## 2. Choose A Model Asset Folder

Recommended example:

```text
/Users/yourname/SlicerDSpace-model-assets
```

Command-line equivalent:

```bash
python3 scripts/download_model_assets.py \
  --profile core \
  --asset-root /Users/yourname/SlicerDSpace-model-assets \
  --source url \
  --source-id slicerdsurfer_models_git
```

---

## 3. Prepare Subject Data

Recommended layout:

```text
/Users/yourname/data/sub-01/
  input/
    data.nii.gz
    bvals
    bvecs
    nodif_brain_mask.nii.gz
```

In SlicerDSpace:

1. Set `Subject ID` to `sub-01`.
2. Set `Subject root` to `/Users/yourname/data/sub-01`.
3. Leave `Output directory` empty unless you need a custom output folder.

## 4. External Tools

MRtrix3, FSL, FreeSurfer, WMA and TractCloud are optional depending on selected
targets. The unified preparation entry can acquire pinned WMA/WMQL/TractCloud
sources and Python wheels without Git. It now includes the official MRtrix3
3.0.8 Intel package for macOS 14.5+, with an architecture-matched Miniforge
bootstrap. This package route has planning tests but awaits real-Mac execution.
Apple Silicon is not silently switched to an Intel/Rosetta environment.
FSL/PNL and other unqualified native routes still use an existing compatible
installation; Linux Conda prefixes cannot be copied to macOS.
WMA path discovery now accepts `Slicer.app/Contents` libraries and installed
SlicerDMRI modules rather than assuming Linux layout. This has app-layout
regression tests, not real macOS scientific acceptance.
FSL has Intel and Apple Silicon distributions; use architecture-matching
installations rather than copying a Linux Conda prefix. [Official macOS FSL](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/docs/install/macos.html).

CUDA eddy is unavailable on macOS. MRtrix/FSL correction uses the CPU eddy
executable; Auto PyTorch also currently uses CPU because this plugin has not
implemented MPS. PNL's TensorFlow Metal plug-in is not a validated acceleration
route and is not labeled CUDA. [PyTorch MPS](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/main/notes/mps.html).

For the least external dependencies, provide a reviewed native brain mask and
select DTI with optional DIPY preprocessing. FW/NODDI/DKI/MK-Curve additionally
need suitable acquisition and compatible numerical packages; they remain
unverified on real macOS data. WMA, SAF and FreeSurfer-style postprocessing need
their shell/CLI/display prerequisites and separate end-to-end validation.

Common examples:

```text
MRtrix bin: /opt/mrtrix3/bin
FSL bin: /usr/local/fsl/bin
FreeSurfer home: /Applications/freesurfer
```

## 5. If Something Fails

Click `Copy diagnostic report` in SlicerDSpace and paste it into your support
message. Include the exact target you tried to run.
