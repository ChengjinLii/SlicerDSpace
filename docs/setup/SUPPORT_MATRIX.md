# Capabilities And Platforms

**Install what the selected route needs**

[Project](../../README.md) | [Documentation](../README.md) | [Quick Start](QUICKSTART.md) | [Release](../release/EXTENSION_READINESS.md) | [中文](SUPPORT_MATRIX.zh-CN.md)

Capability checks detect packages, executables and assets. They do not certify
numerical accuracy for every acquisition or platform.

## Dependency Levels

| Level | Products | Prerequisites |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Inspect/plan | Input preview, validation, plans | Basic imaging runtime; converter for DICOM/NRRD |
| Minimal DTI | Tensor scalars, optional deterministic tracks | SlicerDMRI or supported DTI route and Python packages |
| Anatomical models | DDSurfer/DDSeg/DDParcel | PyTorch, matching assets, route-specific preparation |
| Microstructure | DTI/FW/NODDI/DKI/MK-Curve | Configured numerical packages and eligible acquisition; DTI is default |
| Advanced pathways | CSD/ACT/SIFT2/SAF/fiber bundles | External backend only as selected |
| Connectome | Regional matrices, scene QC | Tractogram/parcellation; weights only for weighted routes |

Install only selected dependencies. Review external-tool and model terms
separately from runtime readiness.

## Evidence By Platform

| Check | Linux | Windows | macOS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Resource/CMake contract | Local evidence; CI configured | CI configured; execution evidence needed | CI configured; execution evidence needed |
| Real Slicer GUI/source install | Dated local records | Not certified | Not certified |
| Real SDK/CTest/CPack | Linux/Slicer 5.10 candidate verified 2026-10-22 | Requires real SDK acceptance | Requires real SDK acceptance |
| Scientific workflows | Only recorded routes/data | Native not certified; WSL setup is not native acceptance | Not certified |
| Advanced backends | Only recorded routes | Tool/WSL limitations | Tool-specific limitations |

The Linux record includes a real CPack archive and local installation with
isolated settings; see the [official integration record](../release/OFFICIAL_SLICER_VALIDATION_20261022.md).
It does not establish acceptance of later changes, a clean machine, online
store installation or other platforms. Resource checks are not three-platform
Slicer builds. See the [release gate](../release/EXTENSION_READINESS.md).

## Feature Routes

**Native candidate** describes source feasibility, not native scientific acceptance.
WSL is a Linux backend, not native Windows computation. Windows/macOS do not
inherit Linux QC or timings.

## Practical Limits

- Preserve existing reviewed native masks on all platforms. No error-triggered silent algorithm substitution.
- Linux defaults to PNL generation. Fresh Windows configs from the explicit WSL installer default to MRtrix masking; existing defaults are preserved. Without WSL, supply a reviewed mask or explicitly select the Python-only DIPY mask candidate. See [lightweight routes](EXPERIMENTS.md).
- Auto PyTorch uses CUDA when available, otherwise CPU. **Apple MPS is not implemented/validated**; this is not lack of Mac GPU hardware. PNL does not label unvalidated TensorFlow Metal execution as CUDA.
- Windows setup defaults to `-Device auto`, detects the GPU inside WSL and verifies actual PyTorch CUDA allocation. Explicit CUDA errors are not retried on CPU.
- FSL requires explicit license acceptance. Installers do not change NVIDIA drivers or install replacement Linux display drivers.
- WSL process-tree cancellation and Windows/macOS scene reintegration require real-host acceptance. Unit/source checks do not prove every Linux descendant stops on Windows cancellation.
- The [full-brain DKI/MK-Curve records](../release/MODULE_RUNTIMES_20261017.md) concern a specified subject; valid-voxel screening is not a full-brain MATLAB comparison or validation of all acquisitions.

The legacy DDSeg entry now handles `.exe` and `Slicer.app/Contents`; macOS
external Python removes Slicer dylib-path contamination. Details:

## Upstream Boundaries

FSL supports Linux/macOS and Windows through WSL; our wrappers still require host acceptance.
[FSL installation](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/docs/install/index.html),
[FSL Windows](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/docs/install/windows.html).
FreeSurfer's Windows route hosts Linux, not native Windows binaries.
[FreeSurfer requirements](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/SystemRequirements).
PyTorch has MPS support, but this plugin does not yet implement it.
