# Surface Postprocessing Components

**Optional native tools, without a full FreeSurfer installation**

[Project](../../README.md) | [Setup](QUICKSTART.md) | [Platforms](SUPPORT_MATRIX.md) | [中文](SURFACE_COMPONENTS.zh-CN.md)

</div>

DDSurfer snapshot `8a8699c0fda32be7e0a3cbca2903680b9f0c950b` supports surface
postprocessing using seven locally compiled original FreeSurfer commands.
This is native-code reuse, not a Python rewrite, a new numerical method or a
replacement for the complete FreeSurfer suite. Postprocessing remains optional.

## Choose A Route

| Configuration | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Surface component path supplied | Use that verified runtime, without discovering the full suite |
| No component path; existing FreeSurfer detected | Reuse the existing installation |
| Neither supplied | Look for the upstream recipe-matched user cache |

Use **Environment and installation > More options > advanced paths** to set
the optional component directory and your personal activation file. Keep the
component path empty to use an existing FreeSurfer installation instead.
`SLICERDSPACE_SURFACE_RUNTIME` also selects a local runtime; `FS_LICENSE`
selects a personal activation file. An explicitly selected incomplete/corrupt
runtime is an error, not a reason to fall back silently.

The current indexed native `lh/rh.white.obj` and `lh/rh.pial.obj` route is
supported. The historical STL/external-shell route is not converted to a
seven-command backend: it has additional dependencies and a different contract.

## First Preparation

**Check never installs. The GUI preparation route never compiles sources.**
**Prepare selected analysis environment** prefers a qualified prebuilt bundle,
checks archive/file hashes, recipe and native library availability, then saves
the component path. The Linux x86_64 candidate contains seven unchanged native
commands and atlas data: 40,994,566 bytes compressed, about 85.2 MiB unpacked.
It contains no personal activation key. Your own activation remains required.

Publication of this bundle in the model repository is pending. Until published,
place the qualified archive at
`<asset-root>/runtime/surface/surface-runtime-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`, or use an
existing verified runtime/FreeSurfer installation. Missing unpublished bundles
remain visible as manual items; preparation does not fall back to compilation.

Install an offline bundle after reviewing its component/data terms:

```bash
python scripts/setup_surface_runtime.py --execute --accept-terms \
  --asset-root /path/to/assets --offline
```

Without `--execute`, the command only prints its plan. Existing corrupt or
differently built prefixes are not overwritten. The default destination is the
upstream recipe-addressed user cache; `--prefix` selects another empty location.

Maintainers can explicitly use `--build-from-source --jobs 4`; this expert route
requires Git, C/C++ development tools and CMake >=3.24,<4. The upstream builder
and numerical source remain unchanged. `scripts/package_surface_runtime.py`
packages a verified matching build without an activation key. Platform, source
revision, build recipe, file hashes and archive size are recorded in
`models/runtime_bundles.json`. A bundle is enabled for online download only after
it is published and its distribution permissions are cleared.

---

## Run And Verify

```bash
python run_subject_pipeline.py --subject-root /data/sub-01 --subject-id sub-01 \
  --targets surface_postprocess --postprocess-runtime /data/local-components \
  --postprocess-license-file /data/private/freesurfer-license.txt --execute
```

Use the same subject root containing the reconstructed native OBJ masters, or
provide `--postprocess-native-dir`. `--postprocess-freesurfer-home` remains
available for the full-installation route. SynthStrip and its model are separate;
the seven surface commands do not supply masking.

The component manifest, source revision, library availability and checksums are
verified in an isolated worker. The activation precheck tests file presence,
not a license grant; the original tools still perform their activation checks.
Output geometry, morphometry and annotation integrity are checked separately.
QC success does not replace anatomical review. Runtime identity is recorded in
the manifest and cache signature; switching an explicit runtime prevents reuse
of the previous runtime's completion state.

The qualified prebuilt bundle is currently **Linux x86_64 only**. macOS source
compilation and native Windows are not certified; Windows/WSL is not equivalent
to native Windows support. Existing platform-native FreeSurfer remains an
alternative where supported. No end-to-end computation speedup is claimed.

## Attribution

The FreeSurfer commands and atlases retain the
[FreeSurfer agreement](../../licenses/FreeSurfer.txt) and third-party terms.
The pinned backend also includes its [data notices](../../anatomy/surface/ddsurfer_backend/postprocessing/assets/LICENSE.txt).
Personal activation files are never included in packages, model mirrors or
automatic downloads. See [implementation provenance](../architecture/IMPLEMENTATION_PROVENANCE.md).
