# Windows Setup

SlicerDDSurfer runs its native Slicer/Python stages on Windows. Linux-only
command-line backends (MRtrix3, FSL, FreeSurfer, WMA and TractCloud) run in an Ubuntu
WSL 2 distribution through generated Windows command bridges.

## 1. Prerequisites

Install these once:

- 3D Slicer for Windows.
- WSL 2 with an Ubuntu distribution and a normal (non-root) default user.
- A FreeSurfer license file if FreeSurfer postprocessing is required.

The installer deliberately uses `wsl.exe --user root` only for Ubuntu `apt`.
The scientific runtime and downloaded sources are installed as the normal WSL
user; the Linux script never calls `sudo`.

Confirm the distribution name from PowerShell:

```powershell
wsl.exe --list --verbose
```

## 2. Inspect the Reproducible Plan

Plan mode performs no WSL, package, registry or Slicer changes. It is also safe
to use before WSL has been installed.

```powershell
Set-Location D:\SlicerDDSurfer
.\scripts\install_deps_windows.ps1 `
  -Distro Ubuntu `
  -PlanOnly `
  -PlanOutput D:\SlicerDDSurfer-test\windows-install-plan.json
```

The plan records every pinned version, source commit, resource URL and digest.

## 3. Install the Full Runtime

Pass the local Slicer executable and your own FreeSurfer license:

```powershell
.\scripts\install_deps_windows.ps1 `
  -Distro Ubuntu `
  -SlicerExecutable "C:\path\to\Slicer.exe" `
  -FreeSurferLicensePath "C:\path\to\license.txt"
```

This command really executes the following idempotent operations:

1. Installs fixed Ubuntu packages as WSL root.
2. Verifies and installs Miniforge `26.3.2-3`.
3. Creates a Python 3.10 runtime with MRtrix3 `3.0.8` and the pinned runtime
   requirements in `scripts/wsl/requirements-runtime.txt`. TractCloud uses the
   official PyTorch `2.11.0+cpu` wheel, so a CPU workstation does not download
   an unused CUDA runtime.
4. Creates a separate FSL environment from the official FSL conda channel,
   pinned to Eddy `2602.0` (`hb35a746_0`) and topup `2203.5`
   (`ha905fa9_6`). The generated command bridge sets `FSLDIR` and
   `FSLOUTPUTTYPE=NIFTI_GZ` for every MRtrix/FSL invocation.
5. Checks out exact TractQuerier, WhiteMatterAnalysis and TractCloud commits.
6. Downloads TractCloud v1.0.0 data and both ORG atlas archives with SHA-256
   verification.
7. Downloads FreeSurfer `7.4.1`, verifies its official MD5, and installs the
   supplied license.
8. Downloads and SHA-256-verifies the core neural model/template profile. An
   existing `model_assets_dir` in `user_config.json` is reused; otherwise the
   assets are stored below the Windows install root.
9. Compiles native Windows-to-WSL command bridges and writes a dependency JSON
   that the SlicerDDSurfer environment panel and CLI can consume.
10. Merges the bridge paths into `%APPDATA%\SlicerDDSurfer\user_config.json` so
   subsequent Slicer sessions discover them without re-entering paths.
11. Downloads Windows wheels for Slicer's exact Python ABI through the managed
    WSL runtime, records their SHA-256 values, installs them into PythonSlicer
    offline, and requires the final environment doctor to pass.

The default Linux root is `~/.local/share/slicerdsurfer`. The default Windows
bridge/config root is `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SlicerDDSurfer\wsl-runtime`. Re-running
the command verifies caches, pinned commits and versions instead of blindly
duplicating them.

The installer refuses to adopt an existing Miniforge or FreeSurfer directory
that has no matching SlicerDDSurfer provenance marker. Preserve that directory
and choose a clean managed location instead, for example
`-WslInstallRoot ~/.local/share/slicerdsurfer-managed`.

FreeSurfer is approximately 9 GB and the two ORG archives total approximately
1.8 GB. Make sure the WSL virtual disk has sufficient free space.

## 4. Defer Large Downloads

To install Miniforge, MRtrix3, the Python runtime, pinned source checkouts,
TractCloud and the Windows bridge while deferring FreeSurfer and ORG data:

```powershell
.\scripts\install_deps_windows.ps1 `
  -Distro Ubuntu `
  -SlicerExecutable "C:\path\to\Slicer.exe" `
  -SkipLargeDownloads
```

Re-run later without `-SkipLargeDownloads` and supply
`-FreeSurferLicensePath`; existing verified components are reused. Use
`-SkipFreeSurfer` only when FreeSurfer is intentionally out of scope.

`-SkipApt` is available for a pre-provisioned/offline Ubuntu image.
`-SkipSlicerPythonInstall` leaves PythonSlicer unchanged while still building
the WSL runtime and bridges. `-SkipUserConfigUpdate` writes the standalone
dependency JSON without changing the persistent GUI/CLI user configuration.

## 5. Verified Mirrors

Every ORG or TractCloud resource URL override requires a matching explicit
SHA-256. The installer refuses a URL-only override:

```powershell
.\scripts\install_deps_windows.ps1 `
  -Distro Ubuntu `
  -OrgRegUrl "https://mirror.example/ORG-RegAtlas-100HCP.zip" `
  -OrgRegSha256 "<64 hexadecimal characters>" `
  -Org800Url "https://mirror.example/ORG-800FC-100HCP.zip" `
  -Org800Sha256 "<64 hexadecimal characters>" `
  -SlicerExecutable "C:\path\to\Slicer.exe" `
  -FreeSurferLicensePath "C:\path\to\license.txt"
```

Equivalent override pairs are available for `TractCloudTrainUrl` /
`TractCloudTrainSha256` and `TractCloudModelUrl` /
`TractCloudModelSha256`.

## 6. Use the Generated Dependency Config

The installer writes:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\SlicerDDSurfer\wsl-runtime\dependency-config.json
```

For command-line runs, pass it explicitly:

```powershell
python run_subject_pipeline.py `
  --subject-root D:\data\sub-01 `
  --targets tractography,wma,tractcloud,connectome `
  --dependency-config "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\SlicerDDSurfer\wsl-runtime\dependency-config.json" `
  --execute
```

The bridge translates drive-letter and `\\wsl.localhost\...` paths before
calling Linux tools. A protected `bash.exe` bridge is placed beside the chosen
Slicer executable so the bundled FreeSurfer shell workflow uses WSL reliably.
The installer refuses to overwrite a pre-existing `bash.exe` that it does not
own. Restart Slicer once after installation so it reloads the persistent JSON;
the installer never terminates an open Slicer process.

## 7. Install Model Assets

The WSL installer covers executable backends and their atlas/model resources.
DDSeg, DDParcel and DDSurfer checkpoints remain managed by the model-asset
installer:

```powershell
python scripts\download_model_assets.py `
  --profile core `
  --asset-root D:\SlicerDDSurfer-model-assets `
  --source url `
  --source-id slicerdsurfer_models_git
```

Set `Model assets root` to the same directory in SlicerDDSurfer. Existing
verified assets are reused.

## 8. Prepare Subject Data

Recommended layout:

```text
D:\data\sub-01\
  input\
    data.nii.gz
    bvals
    bvecs
    nodif_brain_mask.nii.gz
```

In SlicerDDSurfer, set the subject ID and subject root, then run `Check
environment dependencies`. If a stage is still blocked, include the generated
environment report and install plan when reporting the issue.

For `mrtrix_fsl` preprocessing, provide the real phase-encoding direction and
total readout time from the acquisition metadata. Susceptibility correction
with topup additionally requires the subject's reverse-phase spin-echo b0 data.
If those acquisition files are absent, `-rpe_none` can exercise Eddy but cannot
replace a scientifically valid topup correction; do not guess these values for
production processing.
