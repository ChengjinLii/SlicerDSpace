# Download Scope

**Separate plugin installation, lightweight source and research records**

[Project](../../README.md) | [Quick Start](QUICKSTART.md) | [Documentation](../README.md) | [中文](DOWNLOADS.zh-CN.md)

</div>

Running the plugin does not require website source, historical performance
reports or tests. Keep those in the complete repository for development,
auditing and reproducibility, not as installation prerequisites.
The repository remains a private pre-release. These instructions do not imply
an official Extensions Catalog entry or an available public release package.

## Choose A Download

| Purpose | Recommended route | Contents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Use SlicerDDSurfer | Maintainer-provided extension package with corresponding acceptance evidence | Runtime, UI, queries, licenses, user guides and required reference files |
| Install source with repository access | Lightweight checkout below, then staging | Updatable runtime source without website, tests or historical optimization reports |
| Develop or reproduce research | Complete source checkout | Tests, performance evidence, release tools, website source and documentation |
| Inspect performance evidence | Browse the authenticated GitHub repository | No need to copy reports into the plugin installation |

The runtime package excludes `docs/site/`, `docs/website/`, `website/`,
`Testing/`, historical optimization/QC reports, raw benchmark JSON and timing
scripts. A few release documents and runtime CSV references are explicitly
retained. Third-party notices, WMQL queries, WSL helpers and the model manifest
remain included. Weights, templates and external runtimes are separate,
route-dependent downloads, not bundled source code.

## Lightweight Source Installation

Use a **new checkout**, authorized access to the private repository, and Git
with partial-clone/sparse-checkout support. Bash, Git Bash and PowerShell:

```bash
git clone --filter=blob:none --no-checkout --depth 1 https://github.com/ChengjinLii/SlicerDDSurfer.git
cd SlicerDDSurfer
git show HEAD:scripts/extension_runtime/runtime_checkout.txt | git sparse-checkout set --no-cone --stdin
git checkout
python3 scripts/stage_slicer_extension.py --install-root ~/SlicerDDSurfer-extension --link-mode copy --clean
```

On Windows, use `python` if `python3` is unavailable. Set `--slicer-version`
for your Slicer and follow the [module-path instructions](../../README.md#installation).
Staging is a source installation, not official SDK/CPack release certification.

`--depth 1` limits history, `--filter=blob:none` fetches file contents on demand,
and sparse rules select the working tree. **A shallow clone alone still
downloads the current website and reports.** Filtering requires server support;
if Git reports `filtering not recognized by server`, sparse checkout can still
hide files without preventing their transfer. Do not expand this route with
submodule filtering or automatic model downloads. See the official
[git clone](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone) and
[sparse checkout](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-sparse-checkout) documentation.

Update a lightweight checkout:

```bash
git pull --ff-only
git show HEAD:scripts/extension_runtime/runtime_checkout.txt | git sparse-checkout set --no-cone --stdin
```

Then restage and restart Slicer. This checkout does not contain complete tests
or research evidence and is not an independent reproduction. Save local changes
before `git sparse-checkout disable` to fetch the excluded source on demand.
Use `git fetch --unshallow` only if full commit history is also needed, not as a
normal installation step. Some guide links target reports available only in
the full GitHub repository.

## Packages Are Not Source Archives

GitHub's automatic **Source code (zip/tar.gz)** is not an Extension Manager
package. Prefer a CPack extension with corresponding validation. Maintainers
can also generate a clearly labeled local pre-release staging package:

```bash
python3 scripts/stage_slicer_extension.py --install-root /path/to/staging --link-mode copy --clean
python3 scripts/package_slicer_extension.py --extension-root /path/to/staging/SlicerDDSurfer --output /path/to/packages/SlicerDDSurfer.tar.gz
python3 scripts/audit_extension_package.py /path/to/packages/SlicerDDSurfer.tar.gz
```

CMake and staging share `scripts/extension_runtime/runtime_resources.json`;
they no longer recursively collect all of `docs/`. Check the lightweight
selection and package tests when adding runtime resources. Local packaging is
not a substitute for an SDK build, clean installation or scientific acceptance.

The complete-model benchmark freezes its developer harness into the campaign's
`harness/` directory, separately from the runtime snapshot. It must not add
benchmark scripts back into the installable extension to run a comparison.

Do not use `.gitignore` to hide committed reports, delete historical evidence,
rewrite Git history or remove website contributor attribution. Website
deployment stays separate and its build tools are not plugin prerequisites.
