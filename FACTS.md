## 2. The core claim: "without a T1-weighted scan"

What the repo files say:
- The strings "T1" and "T1-weighted" do NOT appear in R/README.md, README.zh-CN.md, QUICKSTART.md, SUPPORT_MATRIX.md, IMPLEMENTATION_PROVENANCE.md, PRODUCT_ARCHITECTURE.md, MODEL_ASSET_TERMS.md, EXTENSION_READINESS.md, CITATION.cff, codemeta.json, .zenodo.json or the s4ext (command: `grep -n -i t1` over those files; no hit).
- What the README does state is the input layout: `data.nii.gz`, `bvals`, `bvecs`, optional `nodif_brain_mask.nii.gz`. No T1 file appears. (R/README.md:100-109; R/README.zh-CN.md:90-97)
- QUICKSTART: "Use authorized, de-identified DWI, matching bval/bvec and a brain mask on the same voxel grid." (R/docs/setup/QUICKSTART.md:18-19)
- DDSeg route uses "five DTI features". (R/docs/architecture/IMPLEMENTATION_PROVENANCE.md:43)

What P/film/FACTS.md says (the film's claim table, P/film/FACTS.md:10):
- Claim allowed: "SlicerDDSurfer reconstructs anatomy directly from diffusion MRI, without a T1-weighted scan." and on-screen "No T1-weighted scan needed at analysis time."
- Evidence it cites: DDSurfer graphical abstract "reconstructs cortical surfaces directly from diffusion MRI without requiring T1-weighted scans."; DDParcel "the DDParcel network no longer requires anatomical MRI data but only the dMRI data."; DDSeg "predict a tissue segmentation directly from new dMRI data ... without requiring anatomical data"; "Repo README input layout: data.nii.gz + bvals + bvecs (+ mask); no T1w input in the GUI."
- Caveat, quoted: "models were trained with T1w-derived labels, so the film says 'at analysis time', never 'T1w-free'."
- Ruled out: "T1w-free" (P/film/FACTS.md:10). MAKING_OF repeats: "'Without a T1-weighted scan' is true **at analysis time**. DDSeg and DDParcel were trained with T1w-derived labels." (P/MAKING_OF.md:113-114)
- Also ruled out in the film ("Not claimed anywhere"): "no registration", "no preprocessing", "fully automatic". The film allows the wording "native diffusion space" (results), not "no registration". (P/film/FACTS.md:13, 21-25)
- The "problem" sentence in the film ("Mapping anatomy has usually meant a second, T1-weighted scan, registered into diffusion space.") is sourced to DDSurfer and DDSeg paper quotes. (P/film/FACTS.md:9)
- FACTS.md records that the spoken line itself omits "at analysis time"; the on-screen line carries it (P/film/FACTS.md:10).
- The line "All in native diffusion space." is sourced to `shared/workflow_catalog.py` ("native-space mesh export") and the DDSurfer paper (results transformed back to native dMRI space after template-space inference) (P/film/FACTS.md:13). Those two sources were not read here.

## 3. Capabilities

Five workflow families (README table, verbatim; R/README.md:28-36):

| Workflow | Products | Main prerequisites |
|---|---|---|
| Input preparation | DICOM/NIfTI/NRRD import, gradient validation, optional mask generation and preprocessing | Appropriate import/preprocessing backend |
| Anatomical reconstruction | DDSeg tissue labels, DDParcel regions, DDSurfer white/pial surfaces | Matching model assets, PyTorch and SlicerDMRI for the selected route |
| Microstructural analysis | DTI FA/MD/AD/RD, optional Free-water, NODDI and DKI, regional summaries | Route-specific packages and acquisition suitability checks |
| White-matter pathways | DTI/CSD tractography, ACT/SIFT2, SAF, WMQL/WMA/TractCloud bundles | Backend-specific tools and assets |
| Structural connectivity | Regional matrices, Slicer scene inspection, QC and provenance | Compatible parcellation and tractogram; SIFT2 weights for weighted routes |

Opening line: "One module, five workflow families:" (R/README.md:28).

Optional and default behaviour:
- "Install dependencies **for the selected route**, not for every possible product. MRtrix3, FSL, FreeSurfer and advanced bundle backends are optional and are not silently installed." (R/README.md:38-40)
- "Microstructure runs **DTI only by default**. Enable Free-water, NODDI or DKI independently under Advanced." (R/README.md:120-121)
- DKI "checks baseline measurements, nonzero shells, gradient directions and design rank before fitting." (R/README.md:121-122)
- MK-Curve: "uses a bundled Python port of the author's algorithm, distinct from standard DIPY WLS/OLS. MATLAB is only an optional reference backend." (R/README.md:122-124)
- Mask: an existing input mask is retained. If one must be generated, the default is "PNL diffusion CNN masking"; SynthStrip, MRtrix and supplied-mask alternatives are selectable. "A missing backend is reported, never silently replaced." (R/README.md:113-118)
- PNL CNN default is not dependency-free: it needs TensorFlow, ANTs and model resources if no mask is supplied. (R/docs/architecture/PRODUCT_ARCHITECTURE.md:36-39)
- Tractography display: "Automatic tractography display uses a capped VTK preview, preserving the full TCK/TRK source; a preview is not the analysis tractogram." (R/README.md:125-126)
- GUI language: English or Chinese, chosen in the header. (R/README.md:89; R/README.zh-CN.md:79)
- "There is no visible Beginner section or automatic first-run wizard in the default interface." (R/README.md:96-97)
- Key results of successful stages load automatically into the current scene; QC reload/replace/clear under Advanced settings > Results and QC. (R/README.md:94)
- Dependency levels (Inspect/plan, Minimal DTI, Anatomical models, Microstructure, Advanced pathways, Connectome): R/docs/setup/SUPPORT_MATRIX.md:18-25. "Capability checks detect packages, executables and assets. They do not certify numerical accuracy for every acquisition or platform." (SUPPORT_MATRIX.md:11-12)
- CLI exists: `run_subject_pipeline.py ... --doctor` or `--plan`. (R/README.md:144-152)
- Slicer client design: "a Slicer-native workflow client, not a replacement implementation of every external scientific tool." (R/docs/architecture/PRODUCT_ARCHITECTURE.md:13-14)
- Managed MRtrix/FSL setup button: Linux x86_64 only; Unavailable on macOS. (R/docs/setup/SUPPORT_MATRIX.md:72; PRODUCT_ARCHITECTURE.md:74-77)
- GPU: "Auto PyTorch uses CUDA when available, otherwise CPU. **Apple MPS is not implemented/validated**". (R/docs/setup/SUPPORT_MATRIX.md:80)
- Compact-UI product list as shown in the screenshot (probe: viewed R/docs/images/slicerdds-compact-en.png): Preprocessing; Surface (native); Surface postprocess; Parcellation; Segmentation; Microstructure "DTI / Free-water / NODDI"; Tractography; Bundles; Connectome. In that image Microstructure, Tractography, Bundles and Connectome are ticked.

## 4. Implementation provenance hedges

Quoted (R/README.md:42-45): "DDSeg is a MATLAB-to-Python/PyTorch reimplementation; SAF and MK-Curve are unofficial Python ports of author MATLAB methods. PNL CNN masking invokes the author's existing Python backend, not a rewritten entire PNL pipeline."

Provenance page (R/docs/architecture/IMPLEMENTATION_PROVENANCE.md):
- Preamble: "Language translation, successful execution, numerical equivalence and anatomical validity are different claims. This page ... does not assert author endorsement or clinical validation." (:11-13)
- DDSeg: "**MATLAB-to-Python/PyTorch reimplementation**, not a newly trained tissue model" (:21). "That complete original-runtime comparison is not claimed here." (a same-input, per-view MATLAB/PyTorch parity study is not claimed) (:45-47). The tissue route uses "five DTI features", not the author's ten-feature MK-Curve tissue network (:43-44).
- SAF: "**Unofficial Python port**, restricted to already co-registered native diffusion surfaces, with documented corrections" (:22). "whole-pipeline bitwise equivalence is **not** guaranteed." (:62-63). Upstream default 90 mm initial-track limit; validated runs used 40 mm (:65-67). "Describe outputs as **surface-constrained tractographic SAF candidates**. A curved display subset is not evidence that all output fibres are U-shaped." (:72-74). Neither mode "imposes adjacent-gyri labels or a U-shaped curvature classifier." (:69-70)
- PNL mask: "**Python integration adapter for existing author Python**, not a MATLAB port or a rewrite of the entire PNL pipeline" (:23). It "does **not** execute the entire PNL preprocessing pipeline or replace PNL's CNN with a locally reimplemented model." (:87-88)
- MK-Curve: "**Unofficial MATLAB-to-Python port**; distinct from standard DIPY DKI" (:24).
- DDSurfer: "Bundled upstream Python plus Slicer orchestration, not a MATLAB rewrite" (:25).
- DTI/Free-water/NODDI: "Library-backed computation" (DIPY/AMICO) (:26).
- WMA/WMQL/TractCloud: "**External author-code integration**, not local algorithm ports" (:27).
- Verification limits: reference checks use original `.m` kernels run in GNU Octave, "not MATLAB itself and not a blanket validation of every optional branch or subject." (:100-103)
- Third-party notice repeats: SAF "author endorsement and whole-pipeline bitwise equivalence are not implied." (R/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md:55-56); MK-Curve "is not an official author-endorsed Python implementation." (:179-180)
- zh README says the PNL backend is "官方" (official) Python backend (R/README.zh-CN.md:38-39); the English README says "the author's existing Python backend" (README.md:43-44).

## 5. Platform and validation status

- Validated: "Linux real-data and GUI evidence is documented in the acceptance campaign (SLICER_ACCEPTANCE_20261007.md); the compact interface has a separate UI validation record. These records describe specific checkouts, routes and datasets, not all future configurations." (R/README.md:158-163)
- Not certified, verbatim: "Native Windows/macOS scientific workflows and three-platform SDK builds are not certified." (R/README.md:174)
- "Fast CI and local installation checks are not substitutes for a real SDK/CTest/CPack build." (R/README.md:173)
- "The Extension Index JSON is a **Tier 1 proposal**, not acceptance by Slicer." (R/README.md:175)
- "Public source access, third-party licensing clearance and asset redistribution review remain release gates." (R/README.md:176)
- "**Current limitation:** no complete genuine SDK build or native Windows/macOS scientific acceptance is asserted by this change." (R/docs/release/EXTENSION_READINESS.md:69-71). Contract tests use "a clearly identified minimal SDK stub". (:70-71)
- Platform matrix (R/docs/setup/SUPPORT_MATRIX.md:34-40): Real Slicer GUI/source install: Linux "Dated local records"; Windows "Not certified"; macOS "Not certified". Scientific workflows: Linux "Only recorded routes/data"; Windows "Native not certified; WSL setup is not native acceptance"; macOS "Not certified". Real SDK/CTest/CPack: all three "Requires real SDK acceptance".
- PNL CNN mask: "**Unavailable in native Windows GUI**" (SUPPORT_MATRIX.md:62).
- "Windows/macOS do not inherit Linux QC or timings." (SUPPORT_MATRIX.md:51-52)
- Release gate table (R/docs/release/EXTENSION_READINESS.md:94-104): real SDK/CPack + clean install "Requires independent evidence"; model/template/fixture redistribution "Unconfirmed groups remain excluded from public asset archives"; real-data tutorial and Sample Data registration "Not completed"; patent: "Maintainer review required; no absence claim is made".
- Extension Index descriptor `docs/release/extension-index/SlicerDDSurfer.json`: tier 1, scm_revision main, build_dependencies SlicerDMRI and PyTorch; "a schema-compatible draft, not a submitted catalog entry." (R/docs/release/extension-index/SlicerDDSurfer.json; EXTENSION_READINESS.md:106-109)
- CI: the README badge tracks main push runs; "the live badge ... is not externally accessible without authorization." (R/README.md:165-168)
- Documented real-data scope is Linux. Later validation records (CSD/ACT, platform audit, etc.) are listed in R/docs/README.md:47-92 but were not read. One recorded caveat: the CSD/ACT investigation "supersedes the earlier CSD acceptance ... old ACT-dependent outputs require regeneration." (R/docs/README.md:49-51)
- Film run platform: macOS, Apple M4, x86_64 Slicer 5.12.4 under Rosetta, CPU only. P/MAKING_OF.md:73-74, 144-145 ("SlicerDDSurfer is validated on Linux. This run used macOS ... and needed the run-time workarounds in §10.")

## 6. Install / quick start (as written)

Source/staging install (R/README.md:51-67). It is "a **source/staging installation**, not an official CPack release".
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChengjinLii/SlicerDDSurfer.git
cd SlicerDDSurfer
python3 scripts/stage_slicer_extension.py \
  --install-root ~/SlicerDDSurfer-extension --link-mode copy --clean
```
- Then in Edit > Application Settings > Modules, add `~/SlicerDDSurfer-extension/SlicerDDSurfer/lib/Slicer-5.10/qt-scripted-modules` (expanded to an absolute path) to Additional module paths, then restart Slicer. Set `--slicer-version` to the actual version. Updating the source needs restaging and a restart. (R/README.md:61-67)
- Install SlicerDMRI and PyTorch from Slicer's Extension Manager for routes that need them. (R/README.md:66-67)
- Model files live outside the checkout; choose a writable directory in Advanced settings > Environment and models. Review the asset terms first. (R/README.md:69-71)
```bash
python3 scripts/download_model_assets.py --profile surface \
  --asset-root ~/SlicerDDSurfer-model-assets --source url \
  --source-id slicerdsurfer_models_git
```
- Broader profile: `scripts/download_model_assets.sh --profile core`. "Availability and SHA256 verification do **not** establish redistribution rights." (R/README.md:79-81)
- Quick start steps (R/README.md:89-94): 1 select SlicerDDSurfer, choose English or Chinese; 2 enter Subject ID, Subject root, optional Output directory; 3 select only needed products; 4 open Advanced settings, configure routes, dependencies, models, check environment; 5 click Run SlicerDDSurfer (missing inputs show in red); 6 key results appear in the scene; review under Advanced settings > Results and QC.
- Canonical input layout (R/README.md:100-109):
```text
sub-01/
  input/
    data.nii.gz
    bvals
    bvecs
    nodif_brain_mask.nii.gz   # optional; generation needs a supported backend
```
- "DWI and mask must share a voxel grid. Gradient files must match the DWI measurements. Corrected gradients must accompany motion-corrected DWI." (R/README.md:111-113)
- Minimal DTI-only run and synthetic installation check: R/docs/setup/QUICKSTART.md:29-69. The synthetic subject is "a small constant tensor field with seven measurements, **not human anatomy**". "A redistributable real-data tutorial and Sample Data registration remain future milestones; neither is claimed as complete." (QUICKSTART.md:63-69)
- Release procedure files (RELEASE.md:17-25): three classes: source in this repo; model assets in the separate `SlicerDDSurfer-models` repo; external software installed separately.

Display-subset caveats (P/MAKING_OF.md:26-45):
- "Tractography: 24,000 of 130,780 streamlines (length >= 30 mm, random subset, seed 7), resampled every 2.5 mm. This is our display subset; it is not the module's own VTK preview and not the analysis tractogram." (:31-32)
- "Connectome: the 260 strongest of 854 edges are drawn; the matrix panel shows all 84 x 84 nodes." (:33)
- "The Slicer section is a **real screenshot** of 3D Slicer 5.12.4 with the SlicerDDSurfer module." Edits: status bar cropped; 3D view box and axis labels hidden; lateral camera; "Advanced settings > Results and QC" opened; module inputs and ticked products set by script to match the run (six ran: microstructure, segmentation, parcellation, surface, tractography, connectome). (:34-42)
- Volumes upsampled 2x for textures; DEC colour = |principal eigenvector| x FA; white matter labels 2 and 41 drawn grey; GM orange, WM ivory, CSF blue (:26-30).
- The tractography shown is DTI deterministic, labelled "DTI tractography · preview" (P/MAKING_OF.md:117-118).
- Not run for the film and not shown: Free-water, NODDI, DKI, CSD, ACT, SIFT2, SAF, bundles (WMQL/WMA/TractCloud), surface postprocess (P/MAKING_OF.md:115-118, 146). The narration names Free-water, NODDI and kurtosis; the film marks them "optional" in chips (P/film/FACTS.md:11).
- One subject, one session; EDDEN AVG_mag averages 5 repeats so SNR is higher than a typical single scan (P/MAKING_OF.md:142-143). EDDEN publishes no eddy-rotated bvecs; original bvecs were used (:143).
- QC state of the run: automatic QC passed for DTI, DDParcel, DDSurfer; DDSeg world-space QC passed (DDSeg-vs-DDParcel WM Dice 0.848, gate >= 0.70); tractography and connectome "completed"; `human_review` is "pending": "nobody reviewed the outputs as an expert." (P/MAKING_OF.md:76-78)
- Run times (one subject, Rosetta, CPU): DTI 44 s, tractography 50 s, DDSeg 95 s, DDParcel 1956 s, DDSurfer 1089 s, connectome 12 s (P/MAKING_OF.md:75). Own checks: FA vs dataset FA Pearson r = 0.826; principal direction mean |cos| = 0.952 (:84-85).
- Render note: renders are not always bit-identical (P/MAKING_OF.md:157-158).
- Film end card text: "Diffusion MRI workflows in 3D Slicer" and "Research software · Not for clinical use" (P/film/FACTS.md:17-18; visible in cover PNGs). The repository URL is not shown (P/film/FACTS.md:25).
- Claims the film says it does NOT make: "Open source / available now / Extension Manager / version or date; speed or accuracy numbers; clinical use; 'first' or 'only'; cross-platform support; 'U-shaped fibres'; 'no registration'; 'no preprocessing'; 'fully automatic'." (P/film/FACTS.md:23-24)

## 12. Contradictions and gaps

Contradictions between sources:
1. Slicer version. README says 5.10 (README.md:9, 62, 64; images README:14). The film credits 3D Slicer 5.12.4 (P/CREDITS.md:13; MAKING_OF.md:34, 73). The 5.12.4 run was macOS/Rosetta and is not the Linux validation.
2. Licence. R/docs/architecture/PRODUCT_ARCHITECTURE.md:82 says "the extension's MIT license". LICENSE.txt, README, CITATION.cff, .zenodo.json, codemeta say BSD-3-Clause. (The DDSurfer backend inside is MIT; THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md:117-126.)
3. Platforms. codemeta.json:12-18 lists runtimePlatform "Linux, macOS, Windows" and developmentStatus "active". README:174 and SUPPORT_MATRIX say Windows/macOS scientific workflows are not certified.
4. Tag. RELEASE.md:163 mentions "the existing `v0.1.0` tag" and a draft release file. `git tag -l` in R/ lists no tag. CITATION.cff:2 asks users to cite "the tagged software release". HEAD is dated 2026-10-16; date-released is 2026-06-24.
5. Clinical wording. The end card says "Not for clinical use" and P/film/FACTS.md:18 attributes it to the README. The README wording is "A completed run is not a clinical assessment or proof of scientific correctness." (README.md:21-22). The words "Not for clinical use" do not appear in the README.
6. "Official". zh README calls the PNL backend "官方" (official) Python; English says "the author's existing Python backend".
7. DDSurfer citation detail. CITATION.cff has year 2026 and article number e76596 only; P/CREDITS.md:12 adds "13(56)". Not in any repo file read.
8. Description text differs across README, s4ext, CITATION.cff, codemeta, .zenodo.json (section 1). No file defines one official one-line description. README tagline: "Diffusion MRI workflows in 3D Slicer".
9. Final narration line 12 ("Brain anatomy from diffusion MRI, inside 3D Slicer.") has no row of its own in P/film/FACTS.md. The FACTS row for the end card covers the tagline "Diffusion MRI workflows in 3D Slicer" only.

Gaps / claims the sources do NOT support:
10. T1w-independence is not stated in the repo. It appears in P/film/FACTS.md and rests on the three papers (not re-read here) plus the README input layout. Allowed qualifier: "at analysis time". Models were trained with T1w-derived labels (P/film/FACTS.md:10). The sources read do not say whether any optional route (for example "Surface postprocess" FreeSurfer-style refinement, or FreeSurfer) needs a T1w. The README never says "no T1" for the whole module.
11. Availability and openness. The sources say private pre-release, not in the Extensions Catalog, repository private, Index entry only a draft (section 1). Not supported: "open source", "available now", "install from Extension Manager", "download", a release version or date, or any public repo/raw-image link. README:66 says to install the dependencies SlicerDMRI and PyTorch from Extension Manager; SlicerDDSurfer itself is not installed that way. A public site that links the repo or says "available" would contradict RELEASE.md:38-39 and EXTENSION_READINESS.md:11-13 (keep private until an explicit maintainer decision).
12. Performance numbers. No speed, accuracy or benchmark claim is made for the product in the sources. Film numbers (run times, r = 0.826, Dice 0.848, |cos| = 0.952) are one subject, CPU, Rosetta, not benchmarks; the film does not claim them. "Full-brain timing missing" for DKI/MK-Curve (SUPPORT_MATRIX.md:61). Paper speed claims are not in the files read.
13. Clinical use. Not supported. "A completed run is not a clinical assessment" (README.md:21-22). Human review of the film run is "pending" (MAKING_OF.md:78).
14. Cross-platform. Not supported (README.md:174). Linux only for recorded real-data/GUI evidence. The film run was on macOS and needed workarounds (MAKING_OF.md:144-145, 166-181: six maintainer findings, none fixed in the repo).
15. Features shown versus run. Free-water, NODDI, DKI, CSD, ACT, SIFT2, SAF, WMQL/WMA/TractCloud and surface postprocess were not run for the film. The film's tractography is a display subset of a DTI deterministic run (24,000 of 130,780 streamlines); connectome edges 260 of 854. The film run used the CLI, not the Run button.
16. Screenshots. The docs images show a missing-input state, not a result, and the Microstructure label there reads "DTI / Free-water / NODDI" (no DKI). The window.png screenshot shows the label "DTI + optional models". The UI labels differ between the two captures (Slicer 5.10 doc image vs 5.12.4 film image).
17. Acceptance records not read (SLICER_ACCEPTANCE_20261007.md, UI_SIMPLIFICATION_20261008.md, DISTRIBUTION_VALIDATION_20261012.md). The datasets, subject counts and test counts behind "Linux real-data validation" are not on this sheet. Do not state them.
18. "First" or "only", "fully automatic", "no registration", "no preprocessing", "U-shaped fibres": not supported; film FACTS.md rules them out (:21-25), provenance page rules out U-shaped (:72-74).
19. Authors and affiliation. One author, Chengjin Li. No lab or affiliation in the files read. Co-authors appear only on the method papers.
20. Asset licences. Weights, templates and fixtures: redistribution unconfirmed (MODEL_ASSET_TERMS.md:21-26). Do not offer asset downloads on the site. The cover and window screenshots are derived outputs of CC0 data (DATA_LICENSES.md:192-195), but no licence is stated for the images themselves, and window.png shows local paths.
21. Software DOI: none exists in the files read. No Zenodo record is recorded.
