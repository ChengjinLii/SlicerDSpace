"""Launch/kill helpers for a QProcess's whole process tree, not just one PID.

``QProcess.terminate()``/``.kill()`` only signal the direct child process.
When that child is a launcher (e.g. the Slicer executable running
``run_subject_pipeline_cli.py``) that spawns further subprocesses for each
pipeline task (MRtrix, FreeSurfer, dcm2niix, ...), cancelling just the top
process leaves those descendants running as orphans. Launch the child in its
own process group (POSIX, via ``setsid`` or a ``setpgrp`` fallback) and kill
the whole group/tree instead of one PID. This mirrors the approach already
used for setup jobs in ``shared/ui_setup_jobs.py``.

    perl script that calls the ``setpgrp(0, 0)`` syscall directly (making
    the not-yet-``exec``'d process the leader of a new process group of its
    own -- the same property ``setsid(1)`` provides for this purpose) and

    Call this once, right after a grouped launch (``grouped_launch_command``
    returned ``grouped=True``), while the launched process is known to still
    be alive (e.g. immediately after ``QProcess.waitForStarted()`` succeeds),
    and store the result for :func:`kill_process_tree` to use later.

    This deliberately does **not** call ``os.getpgid(pid)`` to look the pgid
    up. Two reasons:

    1. It would race the launched process's own ``setsid()``/``setpgrp(0,
       0)`` call: ``waitForStarted()`` returns as soon as ``exec`` of
       ``setsid``/perl succeeds, which is *before* that process has actually
       made itself its own group leader. Calling ``os.getpgid(pid)`` in that
       window can observe the *inherited* pgid instead (e.g. Slicer's own),
       and a later forced ``killpg()`` against that stale value would signal
       the wrong process group entirely.
    2. It is unnecessary: POSIX only allows a process to make itself the
       leader of a *new* group by setting its own pgid to its own pid
       (that is what both ``setsid()`` and ``setpgrp(0, 0)`` do here -- see
       :func:`grouped_launch_command`). So once that call completes, this
       process's pgid is guaranteed to equal its own pid; there is no other
       value it could be.

    ``pid`` is returned as-is (once validated), letting the eventual
    ``killpg()`` no-op with ``ESRCH`` if called before that setup completes,
    rather than risk targeting the wrong group.
